Statistics and data science are two closely linked topics of study. Almost universally, data science is presented to novices with the assumption that the reader has some expertise in statistics. Although raw observations constitute data, they are not information or knowledge.

* What are the observations' boundaries?
* How does the data appear?

These seemingly basic questions must be answered in order to convert raw observations into information that we can use and share.
